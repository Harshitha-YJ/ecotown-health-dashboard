# Clinical Biomarker Reference Ranges

This document contains general clinical reference ranges for key biomarkers. These values help determine if a user's biomarker levels fall within the healthy range.

> ⚠️ Note: Ranges can vary slightly depending on laboratory methods, patient demographics, and other factors.

| Biomarker        | Normal Range                          | Unit         | Notes                               |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| Hemoglobin       | 13.0 – 17.0 (male), 12.0 – 15.5 (female)| g/dL         | Low indicates anemia                |
| WBC              | 4,000 – 11,000                         | cells/mcL    | High may indicate infection         |
| Platelets        | 150,000 – 450,000                      | /mcL         | Low count can affect clotting       |
| RBC              | 4.7 – 6.1 (male), 4.2 – 5.4 (female)   | million/mcL  | High in dehydration                 |
| Glucose (fasting)| 70 – 99                                | mg/dL        | >126 suggests diabetes              |
| Cholesterol      | < 200                                  | mg/dL        | Includes HDL, LDL, triglycerides    |
| Triglycerides    | < 150                                  | mg/dL        | Elevated in metabolic disorders     |
| HDL              | > 40 (male), > 50 (female)             | mg/dL        | Good cholesterol                    |
| LDL              | < 100                                  | mg/dL        | Bad cholesterol                     |
| Creatinine       | 0.6 – 1.3                              | mg/dL        | Kidney function indicator           |
| Urea (BUN)       | 7 – 20                                 | mg/dL        | High in kidney dysfunction          |
